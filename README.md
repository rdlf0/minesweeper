# Minesweeper

Compile with:

```
$ tsc
```

Then just open `index.html`


# To do:
- ~~performance improvement - precalculation of the cell value on init~~
- settings UI
- game sharing - generate URL with encoded game state
- option for UI hint - highlighting the adjacent cells on hover
